Hey There,
This is my Third project based on Spring and my first project using React...! I've been super enthusiastic and learned new things in this development duration.

Here is the objective of the project.
-Use the Data from the CSV file.
-Render that Data into the Database.
-Use Java for the Backend to Handle API and Storage Related Tasks.
-Use React for Frontend Development.
-Apply Filters.
-Use Visulization to it (D3,charts.js).

How I Developed it.
-Database.
  *PostgresSql.
-Backend.
  *Spring (Spring web, Lombok, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL Driver)
-Frontend.
  *React.js
-Visualization Chart
  *chart.js
This above project shows the graph as the Dashboard where the user can get the required output based on his requirements by applying filters to get Valuable insights.
