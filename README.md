Hey There,
This is my Third project based on Spring and first project using React...! I've been super enthusiastic and leart new things in this development duration.

Here is the objective of the project.
-Use the Data from the CSV file.
-Render that Data into Database.
-Use Java for Backend to Handle API and Storage Related Tasks.
-Use React for Frontend Delvelopment.
-Apply Filters.
-Use Visulization to it (D3,charts.js).

How I Developed it.
-Database.
  *PostgresSql.
-Backend.
  *Spring (Spring web,lombok,Spring Data JPA, PstgreSQL Driver)
-Frontend.
  *React.js
-Visualization Chart
  *chart.js
This above project shows the graph as the Dashboard where user can get the required output based on his requirements by appling filters's to get the valjuable insights.

**Special thanks to Blackcoffer for assign this task to me.**
